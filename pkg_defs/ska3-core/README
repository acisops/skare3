The combine_arch.py script was intended to help to make a combined
package list.  

The intent is that one builds a ska3-dev environment on the two
platforms (linux and osx), exports the package list, and then creates
a combined list using the script.

It is set with the logic that for shared packages the lowest-common
package version is "hopefully" appropriate for the full environment.
However, this may not be true (wasn't for the zeromq package) and also
doesn't neatly scale to adding new operating systems (linux32 and
windows).  The script should probably be updated so that it will have
a single entry/version if all OS naturally share the version and an
explicit version per OS otherwise.

In the interim, manual updates to the ska3-core list are OK.

Note that sherpa has been added to ska3-core but is not in the
"defaults" channel.  Care should be taken so it is not accidentally
removed.
